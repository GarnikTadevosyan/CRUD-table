# CRUD-table
A table built in React.js that includes all the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations with Firebase/Firestore.

Since this is a sample app, firebase-config.js file is uploaded here,
with a real database, do not upload a file that carries information about users or your API keys and similar information
