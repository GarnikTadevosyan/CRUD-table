# CRUD-table
A table built in React.js that includes all the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in Firebase/Firestore.

Since this is a sample application, the firebase-config.js file is loaded here. 
If you have a real database, do not upload a file containing information about users 
or your API keys and similar information.
